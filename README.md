# cmust
A delegate to `cmus-remote`, cmust is a small shell script that allows for daemon-like control over cmus. 

## Why is this necessary?
*It's not*, I just wanted a simple script that I could run when a macro key is pressed. With this script, increments / decrements in the current seek and volume can be configured to a predefined value to meet your needs. Plus it's *dumb simple* to use.
